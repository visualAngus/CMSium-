# CMSium 🧪

**CMSium** is a lightweight, fully customizable Content Management System (CMS) built from scratch by [visualAngus](https://github.com/visualAngus).  
It’s designed for developers and businesses who want full control over their website creation, without the bloat of platforms like WordPress.

> 💡 _Why CMSium?_  
> Because your CMS shouldn't feel like a spaceship just to build a portfolio.
